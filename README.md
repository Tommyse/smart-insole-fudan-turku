## Classifier

### To-Do

- More feature selection/generation methods (better features?)

- Testing features (Which ones are best? Some accuracy comparisons for classifiers)

- Building some different classifiers (Traditional machine learning + Deep learning)

- Unsupervised learning probably should be dropped. I think it wont give us good results.

- Taking a look at semi-supervised learning instead (Labeling mixed unlabeled data based on previous data for more training/testing data?)

- Some parameter tuning for the classifiers (avoiding overfitting and other bad things)

- Ensemble learning (combining results from different classifiers built earlier)

### Implemented

- Basic features from feature selection/generation

- Basic classifiers


## Webapp

### To-Do

- Movesole csv file handling? (parsing it and adding the values to the database)



- Integrating the classifier(s)

### Implemented
- Login and account management

## Ground Rules

### Meetings

1.	Meetings will be held in English. If you don’t know a word, ask another member to help.
2.	Fixed meeting time:  Wednesdays. 14:30 – 16:00 at Agora.
3.	Working with the status report (15 mins) in each meeting.
4.	Each member informs asap, if he cannot attend the meeting.

### Communication

5.	We will use WeChat to keep everybody up-to-date with our project. 
	Each member will check out WeChat once per day.
6.	Inform the team and leader asap, if you cannot make a deadline, have troubles with a task given to you or a problem is coming up.
7.	On Tuesday, each member writes a message on WeChat asking doubts/questions or simply saying “no questions”.

### Norms

8.	We help each other. If you are stuck, ask your team members for help.
9.	To prevent escalation, we address conflicts early on, before we get frustrated.
10.	We use Trello to monitor the progress/milestones.

### Decision making

11.	Decisions will be made only after hearing the opinion of each relevant member.
12.	It is not acceptable to withhold your opinion (“whatever you all think…”) and then later be against the decision made.
