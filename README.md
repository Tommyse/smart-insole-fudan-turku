## Ground Rules

### Meetings

1.	Meetings will be held in English. If you don’t know a word, ask another member to help.
2.	Fixed meeting time:  Wednesdays. 14:30 – 16:00 at Agora.
3.	Working with the status report (15 mins) in each meeting.
4.	Each member informs asap, if he cannot attend the meeting.

### Communication

5.	We will use WeChat to keep everybody up-to-date with our project. 
	Each member will check out WeChat once per day.
6.	Inform the team and leader asap, if you cannot make a deadline, have troubles with a task given to you or a problem is coming up.
7.	On Tuesday, each member writes a message on WeChat asking doubts/questions or simply saying “no questions”.

### Norms

8.	We help each other. If you are stuck, ask your team members for help.
9.	To prevent escalation, we address conflicts early on, before we get frustrated.
10.	We use Trello to monitor the progress/milestones.

### Decision making

11.	Decisions will be made only after hearing the opinion of each relevant member.
12.	It is not acceptable to withhold your opinion (“whatever you all think…”) and then later be against the decision made.
